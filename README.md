# Start-Any-VM-On-Connect
The Start-Any-VM-On-Connect project is designed to automate the startup of virtual machines (VMs) upon detecting incoming TCP connections on specific ports. This innovative approach leverages network connectivity to manage VM lifecycle events, enhancing efficiency and flexibility in virtualized environments. 
## Key Features

- **Port-Based Triggering**: The system listens for incoming connections on a range of TCP ports, starting from common web traffic ports like 80 and 443, up to remote access ports such as 3389 (RDP) and 22 (SSH). When a connection attempt is detected on any of these configured ports, the system triggers the startup of a designated VM.
- **Cost Optimization**: By only running VMs when needed, this solution can significantly reduce operational costs—potentially saving up to 90% compared to traditional always-on configurations—especially when combined with cost-effective cloud services like Azure Spot Virtual Machines.
- **Security Integration**: To ensure security, the project integrates with existing firewall rules and network policies to filter out unauthorized access attempts while still allowing legitimate connections to trigger VM startups.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Comprehensive logging capabilities track connection attempts and corresponding actions taken by the system, aiding in troubleshooting and security audits.

## Use Cases

- **Development Environments**: Developers can use this tool to automatically start development servers or test environments when they begin working.
- **Remote Access Scenarios**: IT administrators can configure RDP or SSH servers to start only when needed, improving resource utilization.
- **Cloud Cost Optimization**: In cloud environments where costs are tied directly to running instances, this tool helps minimize unnecessary runtime by starting instances only upon demand.
